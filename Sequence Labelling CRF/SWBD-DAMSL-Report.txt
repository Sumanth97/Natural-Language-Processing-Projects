1. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features:

I divided the given dataset into training data and development data with 25% of the given training data shifted into development data.
When I picked the files randomly, the accuracy was 70.8 and when I picked the last 25% of the files, the accuracy was 71.8. So I picked
the latter. I trained the model with 75% of the data taken as training data. When the model has been trained, I tested it with the 25% of
the data that I have shifted into testing directory i.e development data. I gave the testing data without act tags to the model and
compared the act tags predicted by the model with the true act tags and calculated the accuracy by dividing the total true predictions
with the total number of files tested.

2. Accuracy of baseline features during your evaluation:
The accuracy of baseline features is 0.718127 or 71.81%

3. Describe your advanced feature set:
My advanced feature set consists of the same features of baseline tagger i.e First person or not, monogram tokens and pos tags.
In addition to that I have also considered bi grams, 2 token groups and 3 token groups, Interrogative statements, Agreement,
Opinion, Acknowledgement, Answer statements. I have also considered the presence of interruptive tokens (um, uh-huh,etc),
Abbrevations, Presence of Title and numbers as features.

4. If you tried and rejected alternate advanced feature sets, please describe them:
I have tried Tri grams as features but The accurace was decreased. The same happened for considering using only bi grmas, only
bi and tri grams, single letter dialogue, Dialogues starting with because or As or I and dialogues containing I mean, I believe
or it seems. As the accuracy was decreased, I rejected them and did not consider them for advanced feature tagging.

5. Accuracy of advanced features was:
the accuracy of advanced features is 0.737469 or 73.74%
